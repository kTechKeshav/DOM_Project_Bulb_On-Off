# Bulb Toggle DOM Project

## Overview

This project is a simple web-based application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM manipulation. It features a box containing a bulb image and a button. When the button is clicked, the bulb lights up with a yellow color. Clicking the same button again will turn the bulb off.

## Features
- Toggle between the bulb being ON (yellow light) and OFF with a single button.
- Simple, clean user interface with basic styling.
- A great example of using JavaScript DOM manipulation to create interactive web applications.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML**: Used to structure the elements on the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the bulb, button, and the overall layout.
- **JavaScript (DOM)**: Provides the interactive functionality by toggling the bulb's state.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that controls the behavior of the button and the bulb.

## How It Works
1. When the user clicks the button, a JavaScript function is triggered.
2. The function checks the current state of the bulb (ON or OFF).
3. If the bulb is OFF, it turns ON by changing the background color of the bulb element to yellow.
4. If the bulb is ON, it turns OFF by resetting the background color.
